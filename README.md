# study_advisor_bot
This project was created for the msg Code &amp; Create event during a weekend in July 2020. 

It is a flask app to deploy a website of the "Harward" university via Heroku. Key of the application is the voice assistant, created with DialogFlow. 

You can find the website of our imaginary university at:
https://harward-study-advisor-bot.herokuapp.com/

(Due to the scope of the event, website and chatbot are in German language.)
